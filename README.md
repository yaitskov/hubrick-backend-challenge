# Files

There are three commma separated files in `data` directory:

 * departments.csv  - list of departments
 * employees.csv    - first column contains position of department in alphabetically sorted department list, followed by employee name and salary
 * ages.csv         - first column contains employee name, followed by age

# Challenge

Write a Java program that will generate the following reports in corresponding files.

 * income-by-department.csv - median income by department
 * income-95-by-department.csv - 95-percentile income by department
 * income-average-by-age-range.csv - average income by age ranges with factor of ten
 * employee-age-by-department.csv - median employee age by department

Reports must be generated in a comma separated format with header columns.

# Conditions

 * Code should be compilable with Oracle JDK 1.8 and run with path to directory containing data files as first parameter.
 * Only libraries that are part of Oracle Java Runtime are allowed in production code.
 * provide the solution source code either as zip or as a link to the code repository
 * time cap is hard to quantify, as a rough guideline 3h should be enough but please spend as much time as you need to come up with a solution you are satisfied with and confident about
